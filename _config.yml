about_content: |
  An IT geek since the age of six who had an amazing opportunity to be a part of the pre-internet era experiencing the intensive technological achievements and being lucky enough to play with a wide range of technologies and meeting a bunch of amazing people in that path.

  I find myself as a highly motivated, proactive, reliable and hard-working person. An extrovert and a problem solver. Flexible to adapt in any team or work environment. Friendly, focused and calm in stressed situations.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
